Analysis of Coverage and Test Suite Effectiveness

In this study, we analyse the correlation between code coverage and test suite effectiveness by using real bugs insted of mutants. We analyse two different systems: Apache HTTPClient and Mozilla Rhino and use automated test generation tool Randoop (https://randoop.github.io/randoop/). We observe that

- Test suite size is weakly to strongly correlated with test suite effectiveness.
- Code coverage of a test suite is moderately to strongly correlated to its effectiveness.
